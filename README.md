# Hi there 👋


Hello, I’m Phil! 👋

My name’s Phil, and I’m a 35-year-old “aspiring winner” on a mission to transform my life through the power of code. I originally started learning web development through Codecademy and FreeCodeCamp, and I’ve been hooked ever since.


[![Spotify](https://novatorem.bgstatic.vercel.app/api/spotify)](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4kI8Ie27vjvonwaB2ePh8T?si=eADUsRD1Rti3EHOrOdYpqQ)


## Background

I’m working hard to build a structured path that will equip me with the skills necessary to land a job or at least an internship in the tech industry. Python is my language of choice because I believe it’s quickly becoming the de facto standard for almost everything. Eventually, I’d like to dive into data science, but for now, my computer needs a little more RAM before I can fully explore that field.

## Eager to Contribute

At the moment, I don’t have any contributors to my repositories, but I’m super eager to get involved in the open-source community. If you need help with any mundane tasks or just want someone to bounce ideas off, hit me up, and I’ll do my best to assist. I’m here to learn, grow, and give back as much as I can.

## Interests

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me enjoying life’s simpler pleasures:

	•	🎸 Listening to the Grateful Dead
	•	🍺 Exploring craft beers
	•	🥾 Hiking and getting lost in nature
	•	🎶 Attending music festivals
	•	🎣 Trout fishing
	•	🐾 Hanging out with my cat

## Support My Journey

Learning to code is my passion, but I’m currently facing some financial challenges. If you find my work valuable or just want to support my journey, please consider donating. Every bit helps!
