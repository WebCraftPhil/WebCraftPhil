## Hi there üëã


Hello, I‚Äôm Phil! üëã

My name‚Äôs Phil, and I‚Äôm a 35-year-old ‚Äúaspiring winner‚Äù on a mission to transform my life through the power of code. I originally started learning web development through Codecademy and FreeCodeCamp, and I‚Äôve been hooked ever since.

Background

I‚Äôm working hard to build a structured path that will equip me with the skills necessary to land a job or at least an internship in the tech industry. Python is my language of choice because I believe it‚Äôs quickly becoming the de facto standard for almost everything. Eventually, I‚Äôd like to dive into data science, but for now, my computer needs a little more RAM before I can fully explore that field.

Eager to Contribute

At the moment, I don‚Äôt have any contributors to my repositories, but I‚Äôm super eager to get involved in the open-source community. If you need help with any mundane tasks or just want someone to bounce ideas off, hit me up, and I‚Äôll do my best to assist. I‚Äôm here to learn, grow, and give back as much as I can.

Interests

When I‚Äôm not coding, you‚Äôll find me enjoying life‚Äôs simpler pleasures:

	‚Ä¢	üé∏ Listening to the Grateful Dead
	‚Ä¢	üç∫ Exploring craft beers
	‚Ä¢	ü•æ Hiking and getting lost in nature
	‚Ä¢	üé∂ Attending music festivals
	‚Ä¢	üé£ Trout fishing
	‚Ä¢	üêæ Hanging out with my cat

Learning to code is my passion, but I‚Äôm currently facing some financial challenges. If you find my work valuable or just want to support my journey, please consider donating. Every bit helps!
